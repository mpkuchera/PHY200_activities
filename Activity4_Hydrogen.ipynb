    "**Do not reference your previous code or book for this activity.** The purpose of this activtiy is, like others we have done, to take a mathematical expression of a physics idea and write python code to evaluate it. In fact, I wouldn't expect you to exactly reproduce the code in the book, as there are many subtle differences in how you can code a solutuion to this problem.\n",
