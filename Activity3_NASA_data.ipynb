    ">The Low Resolution OMNI (LRO) data set is primarily a 1963-to-current compilation of hourly-averaged, near-Earth solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameter data from several spacecraft in geocentric or L1 (Lagrange point) orbits. The data have been extensively cross compared, and, for some spacecraft and parameters, cross-normalized. Time-shifts of higher resolution data to expected magnetosphere-arrival times are done for data from spacecraft in L1 orbits (ISEE 3, Wind, ACE), prior to taking hourly averages.\n",
    "LRO also provides other widely accessed data that are frequently used with solar wind data. In particular, LRO provides fluxes of protons with energies above 1, 2, 4, 10, 30, and 60 MeV from several IMP and GOES spacecraft, and provides a wide range of geomagnetic and solar activity indices. The data are made available at daily and 27-day resolutions, in addition to hourly resolution. They are made accessible with a variety of functionalities from https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow.html. \n",
    "High Resolution OMNI (HRO) data set include 1-min and 5-min bow-shock-nose- shifted solar wind magnetic field and plasma data from IMP 8, Geotail, Wind and ACE see: https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow_min.html>\n",
