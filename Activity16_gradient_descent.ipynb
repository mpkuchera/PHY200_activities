    "$$x' = x - \\gamma f'(x)$$ \n",

    "where $\\gamma$ is a stepsize that is theoretically proportional to $\\frac{1}{f''(x)}$. When the magnitude of $x' - x$ is smaller than our target accuracy, we have found our solution. This algorithm works in multiple dimensions.\n",

    "This problem is well-suited for a numerical algorithm because there is one minimum and no way to analytically solve for it.\n",
